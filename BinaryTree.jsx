/* A binary tree is a data structure in which each node can have up to two children, known as a left child and a right child. The nodes are arranged hierarchically and the top node is called the root. Each tree node can have a value, which can be a number, a string, an object, or any other data type. The tree structure allows efficient search for a particular value.

A binary tree can be useful in JavaScript or ReactJS in situations where data needs to be stored and retrieved efficiently. For example, on an e-commerce website, a binary tree can be used to store products and allow users to search for products by name or price. In ReactJS, a component tree is used to represent the hierarchy of components in an application, allowing for efficient management of application state and rendering of components based on changes in state.



Example of a very simple binary tree component in ReactJS.This component renders a binary tree of height 2, where each node has a value and two children(left and right): */

import React from "react";

const BinaryTree = () => {

  const tree = {
    value: "A",
    left: {
      value: "B",
      left: { value: "D" },
      right: { value: "E" },
    },
    right: {
      value: "C",
      left: { value: "F" },
      right: { value: "G" },
    },
  };

  const renderTree = (node) => {
    if (!node) {
      return null;
    }
    return (
      <div>
        <p>{node.value}</p>
        {renderTree(node.left)}
        {renderTree(node.right)}
      </div>
    );
  };

  return <div>{renderTree(tree)}</div>;
};

export default BinaryTree;
